# azure-single-keyvault

The `azure-single-keyvault` environment deploys a single production level AKS cluster configured with Flux and Azure Keyvault.

## Getting Started

1. Copy this template directory to a repo of its own. Bedrock environments remotely reference the Terraform modules that they need and do not need be housed in the Bedrock repo.
2. Follow the instructions on the [main Azure page](../../azure) in this repo to create your cluster and surrounding infrastructure.
